## 🔎 Project Details

### 🖥️ CPP Modules 00-04 – In progress 🟠

- **Objective:** Implementation of the initial C++ modules at 42 School, covering everything from fundamentals to classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Current Status:**  
    - Progress is going well, with **CPP00** and **CPP01** completed. I am currently working on **CPP02**, **CPP03**, and **CPP04**.
- **Challenges Faced:**  
    - The transition from C to C++ and adapting to object-oriented programming required a review of previous concepts.  
    - Using pointers and managing memory in C++ remains a challenge, especially in modules involving dynamic memory allocation.
- **Skills Developed:**  
    - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++, classes, inheritance, polymorphism, memory management, and advanced C++ functions.

#### Module Details:

1. **CPP00 – Introduction to C++**  
    - **Objective:** Introduction to C++, including the use of classes, objects, and basic operators.  
    - **Status:** 🟠 In progress.

2. **CPP01 – Classes and Objects**  
    - **Objective:** Basic concepts of classes, objects, member functions, constructors, and destructors.  
    - **Status:** 🟠 In progress.

3. **CPP02 – Encapsulation and Inheritance**  
    - **Objective:** Apply concepts of encapsulation and inheritance, including base and derived classes.  
    - **Status:** 🟠 In progress.

4. **CPP03 – Polymorphism**  
    - **Objective:** Implement polymorphism, operator overloading, and virtual functions.  
    - **Status:** 🟠 In progress.

5. **CPP04 – Exception Handling and Templates**  
    - **Objective:** Learn how to use exceptions and templates to make code more generic and robust.  
    - **Status:** 🟠 In progress.

### 🎮 cub3D – In progress 🟠

- **Objective:** Create a simple 3D game inspired by classic first-person shooter (FPS) games, using 2D graphics to simulate a 3D environment.
- **Current Status:**  
    - Development is ongoing, with the basic graphics engine (raycasting) already working. Currently, I am working on player movement, environment interaction, and map design.
- **Challenges Faced:**  
    - The primary difficulty has been the calculation and rendering of 3D graphics using raycasting, as well as managing real-time interactions.
    - Working with graphics and real-time physics of movement, while ensuring performance and proper rendering of objects in the scene.
- **Skills Developed:**  
    - Raycasting, basic 3D graphics, movement physics and interaction with the environment, handling images and textures in real-time.

### 🖨️ NetPractice – In progress 🟠

- **Objective:** Solve practical challenges related to networks and sockets, learning to handle networking in C.
- **Current Status:**  
    - The module is in progress, with initial challenges completed, such as creating servers and clients using sockets. I am now working on more complex problems related to network protocols and synchronization between components.
- **Challenges Faced:**  
    - Data communication between the server and client using TCP/UDP sockets has required extra attention to ensure data integrity and connection robustness.
    - Challenges with buffers and data handling in distributed networks.
- **Skills Developed:**  
    - Networking and sockets in C, client-server communication, TCP/UDP protocols, buffer handling, synchronization between processes.
